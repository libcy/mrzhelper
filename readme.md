# MRZ Helper

This is a GUI fortran input file generator I wrote during my internship in PetroChina (I've already obtained a permission for sharing this app). It can be used directly in a browser but works better with an [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) wrapper. Its main features include:

* Add materials and layers and instantly generates the preview of the model
* Show information of certain part of the preview by hovering and edit by left click
* Batch add/edit support (select on the preview by middle button)
* Built-in unit converter, custom command support, input error check, etc.

This app was dedicated for a 2D forward modeling program by PetroChina, but it can be easily modified for a more general purpose, although I currently don't have the time for doing this.
